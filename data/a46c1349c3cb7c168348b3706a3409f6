<CLMS> <CLAIMS> <CLAIM ORDER='0'> What is claimed is: </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='1'> 1. A domestic knitting machine consisting of at least one needle board, a plurality of knitting needles supported in grooves in the needle board, a movable carriage oriented parallel above and to the needle board, the carriage being provided with a lock fitted with an electromagnetic needle selection component, said electromagnetic component being mounted on the lock by means of guiding means permitting free movement of said electromagnetic component in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of the needle board. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='2'> 2. A machine according to claim 1, wherein the guiding means includes at least one guiding rod oriented perpendicular to the plane of the needle board and disposed laterally to the side of the electromagnetic component. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='3'> 3. A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the guiding means further includes means permitting pivotal movement about a pivot axis disposed parallel to the plane of the needle board and laterally to the side of the electromagnetic component. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='4'> 4. A machine according to claim 3 additionally including a spring bearing on the electromagnetic needle selection component urging said component toward said needle board. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='5'> 5. A machine according to claim 3, characterized in that the pivot axis is parallel to the plane of the needle board and parallel to the grooves of the needle board receiving the needles so that the needles can slide and said axis is located behind the electromagnetic component with respect to the direction of active movement of the component. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='6'> 6. The invention of claim 2, characterized in that the guiding means further includes means permitting pivotal movement about a pivot axis disposed parallel to the plane of the needle board and laterally to the side of the electromagnetic component. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='7'> 7. The invention of claim 6, additionally including a spring bearing on the electromagnetic needle selection component urging said component toward said needle board. </CLAIM> <CLAIM ORDER='8'> 8. The invention of claim 7, characterized in that the pivot axis is parallel to the plane of the needle board and parallel to the grooves of the needle board receiving the needles so that the needles can slide and said axis is located behind the electromagnetic component with respect to the direction of active movement of the component. </CLAIM> </CLAIMS> }
