2,In a heat pump system of the type including a compressor; a fluid reversal means; an indoor coil; an outdoor coil; first and second expansion means; means for conducting refrigerant in a first closed circuit path from said compressor through said reversal means to said outdoor coil and then through said first refrigerant expansion means to said indoor coil and back to said compressor; said reversal means being adapted to be repositioned to allow refrigerant from said compressor to flow in a second closed circuit path to said indoor coil through said second refrigerant expansion means to said outdoor coil and then back to said compressor the improvement comprising a heat exchanger for bringing fluid returning to said compressor into heat exchange contact with high pressure liquid from said indoor coil during flow in said second closed circuit path and means for bypassing said heat exchanger during flow in said first closed circuit path.
2,Apparatus as defined in claim 1 including a heat exchanger through which low pressure refrigerant vapor flows in returning to said compressor; a first conduit conducting hot condensed refrigerant from said indoor coil through said heat exchanger in heat exchange relation with said low pressure refrigerant vapor; and a second conduit adapted to conduct hot condensed refrigerant from said outdoor coil directly to said first expansion means.
2,Apparatus as defined in claim 2 including a suction line accumulator upstream from said compressor and said heat exchanger.
2,A heat pump system comprising: a refrigerant compressor; a reversing valve; an outdoor coil; a heat exchanger including means defining first and second independent fluid paths adapted to transfer heat therebetween; an indoor coil; a first refrigerant line connecting the discharge from said compressor to said reversing valve; a second refrigerant line connecting said reversing valve to said outdoor coil; a third refrigerant line connecting said outdoor coil to said indoor coil said third refrigerant line having a first section thereof including a first capillary and a first check valve permitting flow through said first section only in the direction toward said indoor coil; a fourth refrigerant line connecting said indoor coil with said reversing valve; a fifth refrigerant line connecting said reversing valve to said first fluid path in said heat exchanger; a sixth refrigerant line connecting said first fluid path to the suction side of said compressor whereby upon operation of the system in the cooling cycle refrigerant passes from compressor discharge in series through said first refrigerant line said reversing valve said second refrigerant line said outdoor coil said third refrigerant line said first check valve said first capillary said indoor coil said fourth refrigerant line said reversing valve said fifth refrigerant line said heat exchanger and said sixth refrigerant line; a seventh refrigerant line connecting a second section of said third refrigerant line with said heat exchanger through said second fluid path for effecting heat transfer to refrigerant flowing through said first fluid path; an eighth refrigerant line connecting said second fluid path with said outdoor coil said line including a second check valve and a second capillary whereby upon operation of the system in the heating cycle refrigerant passes from compressor discharge in series through said first refrigerant line said reversing valve said indoor coil said second section of said third refrigerant line said seventh refrigerant line said second fluid path said eighth refrigerant line including said second check valve and said second capillary said outdoor coil said second refrigerant line said reversing valve said fifth refrigerant line said first fluid path on the opposite side to flow from said indoor coil and said sixth refrigerant line to compressor suction.
